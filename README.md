# Flashy: Multilingual Flashcard App

## Description
Flashy is a versatile flashcard application designed to facilitate vocabulary learning in any language. Built using Python with Tkinter for a seamless GUI experience and pandas for efficient data management, this app allows users to interactively learn and review words through a front-and-back card format. It's initially set up for Japanese to English, but it can easily be adapted for any language pair.

## Features
- **Interactive Flashcards**: Click to flip cards and reveal translations.
- **Customizable for Any Language**: Easily replace the word list to suit any language learning needs.
- **Progress Tracking**: Words are automatically marked as learned and removed from the rotation, with progress saved between sessions.
- **Aesthetic GUI**: Enhances user experience with aesthetically pleasing elements and smooth interactions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter for the GUI
- Pandas for CSV data management & storage
- Random module for card selection

## Setup and Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaadNasir92/Flashy
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```
3. **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Flashy
    ```
3. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
## Customizing the Flashcard Data
To adapt Flashy for different language pairs or vocabulary lists:

1. Prepare your vocabulary list in a CSV format with two columns: Name of Target Language for eg. Japanese (for the question) and Native language for eg. English (for the answer). Please see format of initial file for exact format.
2. Replace the `FILENAME` variable with your CSV or ',' separated .txt file. Make sure to maintain the column headers as TARGET LANGUAGE NAME and NATIVE LANGUAGE for eg. my Japanese to English default shows ``Japanese,English``.
3. If it's your first time running with a new list, or want to start a new list, ensure the application reads your CSV by removing any existing `'words_to_learn.csv'` file. This triggers the app to rebuild this file based on your new CSV.
4. If you want to revert to a previously saved word list, simply replace the current `'words_to_learn.csv'` with your backup copy. This allows you to easily switch between different sets of vocabulary as needed.

## How It Works
- **Learning Mode:** Displays a word or phrase. Click 'Flip' to view the translation or definition.
- **Review Mode:** Allows marking words as 'known' or 'unknown' to tailor the learning list to your progress.

## Lessons Learned:

- **Dynamic Data Management**: Enhanced skills in handling CSV files with pandas, ensuring real-time data updates and persistence between sessions.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Developed strategies to gracefully manage missing files, improving the applicationâ€™s reliability and user experience.
- **GUI Development:** Gained proficiency in using Tkinter for creating engaging and user-friendly interfaces, emphasizing the importance of good design in educational tools.
- **Customizability in Software**: Learned to design flexible and adaptable applications, allowing easy customization for different user needs.
- **Applied Programming Concepts**: Reinforced knowledge in core programming principles through practical application, strengthening understanding of loops, conditionals, and function management in a real-world project.

## Future Improvements
- Add sound effects and visual feedback for card flips.
- Expand the database capabilities to include more complex phrases and additional language support.
- Implement a scoring system and timed quizzes to enhance the learning experience.
